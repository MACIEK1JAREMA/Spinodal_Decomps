# Spinodal_Decomps
Study Spinodal Decomposition using Monte Carlo techniques as well as differential equations solvers with TDGLT.
Demonstrates scaling form of the structure factor and the dynamical scaling exponent in 2D Ising systems.
It also considers convergence of results with finite size effects and extends MC simulated models and analysis to anisotropic and frustrated systems.
